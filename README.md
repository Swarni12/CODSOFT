I have completed 3 tasks given by Codsoft during my Internship Period.

Task 1: Number Game
In this game we have first generated a random number within a specified range and then asked the user to guess the number. Each user/player is given 5 rounds and there are 3 guesses in each round. It's the user's choice if he/she wants to quit the game before 5 rounds or wants to continue playing. 

Task 2
It was the Grade Calculator in which the user is supposed to enter marks in various subjects and then display total marks, average percentage and the corresponding grade.

Task 3
It includes 2 classes one is ATM, and another one is BankBalance. It has methods such as getBankBalance(), Withdraw(Amount), Deposit(Amount).
